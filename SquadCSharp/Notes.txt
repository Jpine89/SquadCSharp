Refactoring Code Ideas:
    Change Test2.cs to an actual name class. 
    Add new Util like class for all case objects. 
        This would allow us to quickly and easily find code and make it so each case object is seperated into it's own function
    Look into creating an API for all Database Calls. 
        This would remove any concerns that people would have access to the database backend code.

New Function Ideas:
    Add a new Case Statement for IP Logging
